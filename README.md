PathfindingProject
A Pathfinding Visualizer built with modern web technologies. This project helps users visualize popular pathfinding algorithms such as BFS, DFS, and Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm in an interactive grid. It is designed to improve understanding of how these algorithms work in real time.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
This web application allows users to:

Create a grid with customizable walls and weights.

Select source and destination nodes.

Visualize how different algorithms explore the grid to find the shortest path.

Watch animations of the search process and final path.

Itâ€™s an educational tool aimed at students, developers, or anyone curious about pathfinding algorithms.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js

Styling: Tailwind CSS

State Management: React Hooks

Visualization: Custom SVG/DOM manipulation (no external graph libraries like D3.js)

âœ¨ Features
