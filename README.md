# PathfindingProject

A **Pathfinding Visualizer** built with modern web technologies. This project helps users visualize popular pathfinding algorithms such as **BFS**, **DFS**, and **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm** in an interactive grid. It also supports automatic wall generation using **Binary Tree** and **Recursive Division** maze generation algorithms.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This web application allows users to:

- Create and customize a grid.
- Set source and destination nodes.
- Visualize how different pathfinding algorithms explore the grid.
- Generate mazes/walls automatically using:
  - **Binary Tree algorithm**
  - **Recursive Division algorithm**
- Watch animations of the search process and final path.

It serves as an educational tool to help users understand graph traversal and pathfinding techniques.
